This is a technique to identify different characters based on their shape. Most often you must have heard of Optical Mark Recognizer which is used to identify whether a given option is selected in different forms in hospitals, schools and banks.
Along with that there is a clear instruction of filling the shape full not leaving any empty but why is that so?
This is because the selection is identified on the basis of color difference where the shape with the most color is selected as the correct option and all that good stuff is done by an encoded machine.
